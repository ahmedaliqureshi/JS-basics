// there are maily 2 mehtods to calculate 
// the area of the triangle

// 1st method:- is use of the base and hegiht and then deviding it by half 
// logic= (base*height)/ 1/2
console.log('using 1st method:- \n');
console.log('we are going to declare the varibale and there value \n');

// we are going to declare the variable as let of base and height 

let base= 4; 
let height= 10; 

// now we are going to make an varibale and assign the formula to it 

console.log('then we ar going to use the formula of (base*height)/1/2 \n');
let formula= (base*height)/ 1/2; 
console.log('then we are going to print the vlaue= \n');
console.log(formula);


// the 2nd method is the use of the sides to multiply 

console.log('2nd method:-');
console.log('then we are going to use the formula of side*side*side\n');
let side1=3; 
let side2=3; 
let side3=3; 
console.log('then we are going to multiply 3 sides of the triangle \n');
let formula2= side1*side2*side3; 
console.log('the result is= \n');
